Proxy methods: (logic and storage is separated)

1. external storage
2. transparent proxy

   upgrade function is in the proxy contract
4. universally upgradeable proxy (UUPS)

   upgrade function is in the logic/implementation contract
6. beacon proxy

   upgrade a lot of contracts at the same time
8. diamond proxy

Problems about proxy:

1. function collision
2. storage collision
